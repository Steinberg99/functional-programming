# functional-programming

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my repository for the two week course functional-programming! Here you can find the website I produced during the first week of this course. We were tasked to write functions that could parse some data into a more suitable form. These functions had to adhere to the functional programming paradigm. The data we had to use was gathered by a questionnaire that me and my classmates had to complete on the first day of the course. This questionnaire contained the following question.

- What color of clothing are you wearing today?

I used the answers to this question to create my visualizations. Feel free to clone this repository and take a look!
